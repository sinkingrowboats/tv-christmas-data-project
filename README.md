The made for TV Christmas Project a project that I conceived of as a way to better teach myself D3.js. In doing this project, I've decided to take data on my favorite genre of films, the pinnacle of the art of filmmaking, the made for TV at the christmas movie. In the current state of the project, the site is just a graph that plots all of the cheesie crhistmas movies that were on Netflix last christmas season. The x-axis of the graph represents the quality of the movie, the y-axis is the attractiveness of the male lead. The plan is to have the movie descriptions up by christmas, as well as some other visualizations pertaining to other collected data on these movies. So, enjoy.
